# THE VISUAL ARCHIVE

Cartography is mainly a social process. No amount of high-resolution mapping can match the credibility and legitimacy of community-led /commons-oriented social mapping.

Assuming many ways of knowing and multiple systems of knowledge, cartographic-making is a ritual that starts with a collective and political encounter.

The Visual Archive hosts social technology practices and participatory cartography from the Global South as an endogenous product of the multiple relationship between body-territory-language. It brings together customs, organisational arrangements, local knowledge, ecology of the region, and its historical, economic, social and cultural reality.

> This archive was launched to gather resources from the workshop 'Rituals in the Cartographic Practice' organised in March 2023 at the Design Academy of Eindhoven. The archive is dedicated to the territories belonging to Original Peoples who re-exist epistemic racism.
