# THE VISUAL ARCHIVE

Cartography is mainly a social process. No amount of high-resolution mapping can match the credibility and legitimacy of community-led /commons-oriented social mapping.

Assuming many ways of knowing and multiple systems of knowledge, cartographic making is a ritual that starts with a collective, political encounter.

The visual archive hosts social technology practices and participatory cartography from the Global South as an endogenous product of the multiple relationship between body-territory-language. It brings together traditions, organisational arrangements, local knowledge, the natural potential of the region, and its historical, economic, social and cultural reality.

> This archive was launched to gather resources from the workshop 'Rituals in the Cartographic Practice' organised in March 2023 at the Design Academy of Eindhoven.
