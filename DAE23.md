# RITUALS IN THE CARTOGRAPHIC PRACTICE 
DAE, 28-29-30 March 2023

#### *Abstract*

`Rituals are place-based processes that embody a sequence of activities involving gestures, words and objects, performed and designed to address the goals and concerns of the participants in order to bring about a personal or group transformation. Cartographers may use social technology practices, techniques and tools to co-enact processes with human groups organised in communities in the form of rituals or to participate in ongoing rituals.
The cartographer plays the orchestrator, a facilitator in the collective ritual involved in supporting communities in transforming the scales of human knowledge into a representation of the space or putting in place an instrument to read the space. Their role is to unravel the relationships between our body and the physical or virtual space, help us gain orientation, chronicle the past and plan the future.`

`We shall therefore journey around the globe ‚Äìsouth of the 40th parallel north‚Äì to observe, listen and learn about some rituals involving cartography beforehand understanding how to practise them collectively. We will perform these to assemble the social, technical, scientific cartography, the mental image, the narrative of territories seen in the imaginary of the majority as empty space, remote and hostile to humans: the frozen landscape, the seclusion of the desert and the impenetrable dense forest.` 

`In order to give these regions their own unique representation through cartography, we will determine if and how to tame the myth of pristine wilderness coming from a scientific perspective. Human influence is visible in wilderness nearly everywhere, People have shaped most of terrestrial nature for at least 12,000 years, according to a highly recommended publication from 2021 by the same name  (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Vol. 118, Issue 17). In this publication, biologists, archaeologists, geologists, geographers, ecologists, and cultural anthropologists,  together with Indigenous Peoples, assist us in visualising and approaching a paradigm shift.`

`Scientific findings that were also achieved by the analysis of remotely sensed images captured by satellites and drones, which record the extremely recent history of a large section of the planet in millions of terabytes. In this regard, the emergence of a multilevel, multiresolution computational planetary scale was predicted. A universal system of addresses that allows every object on the cosmos, planet or virtual space to be located and informed, enabled by a legion of sensors, algorithms and robots, and dictated by political geography. Benjamin H. Bratton's book The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2015) is suggested to further explore the subject.`

`A question arises. Has this computational planetary scale granted enough data to present a comprehensive portrayal of these territories that goes beyond a stratification of trees, a succession of glacial lakes and valleys, a barren area with no precipitation, on which the boundaries of disputed administrative regions, military information and the limits of extractive exploration and exploitation grounds are superimposed?
The answer is no. Cartography is mainly a social and political process. No amount of high-resolution mapping can match the credibility and legitimacy of community-led social mapping. We will focus on these under-discussed subjects.`

`We will employ social technology techniques applied to cartography to identify solutions that result from human interaction while taking into account customs, organisational arrangements, local knowledge, and economic, social, and cultural realities. In contrast to a ready-made solution produced by generic and commercial algorithms, the resulting cartography will therefore be an endogenous product out of a proxy filtered by a selected multidisciplinary analysis on local knowledge and scientific information. For each instance we explore, we will aim to see, listen, question, collect, empower, offline, and represent.`
 
`Drawing will give way to digital mapping, and we'll get taste of mapping by simulating offline conditions like on a glacier, in a desert, and in a forest. Following the mental map we created by understanding and analysing the foundational resources delivered for study and review, we will publish the findings of the journey online and synthesised in a printable map.`

`We do not profess to be experts on a region or provide an authentic representation of it. Rather, we work in large groups with the goal of understanding a process in a ritual. 
Nevertheless, three books to reflect on the three typologies of the region under investigation are suggested, one for each. Giulia Foscari / UNLESS, Antarctic Resolution (Zurich: Lars M√ºller Publishers, 2021); Diana K. Davis, The arid lands. History, power, knowledge (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2016); Patrick Roberts, Jungle. How tropical forests shaped the world - and us (London: Penguin General, 2022).`

The Visual Archive hosts social technology practices and participatory cartography from the Global South as an endogenous product of the multiple relationship between body-territory-language. It brings together customs, organisational arrangements, local knowledge, ecology of the region, and its historical, economic, social and cultural reality <br> <https://globe.vado.li>
